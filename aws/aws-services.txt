1. User
What it is: A user is an individual identity with long-term credentials (username + password or access keys).

Use case: Typically represents a person who interacts with AWS services (e.g., a developer or admin).

Permissions: Directly assigned via policies.


2. Group
What it is: A group is a collection of IAM users.

Use case: Used to manage permissions for multiple users at once (e.g., developers, testers).

Permissions: Attached to the group, automatically inherited by all members.

3. Role
What it is: A role is an AWS identity with temporary credentials.

Use case: Used for: 

AWS services (like EC2, Lambda) to perform actions on your behalf.

Cross-account access.

Federated users (e.g., users authenticated via Google, Okta, etc.).

Permissions: Granted via policies attached to the role.

How AWS Services Use These:
EC2 instances can assume IAM roles to access S3, DynamoDB, etc., without hardcoding credentials.

Lambda functions use roles to get permission to access AWS resources.

Users/groups are used mainly for human access (e.g., logging in to the AWS Console or using the CLI).
